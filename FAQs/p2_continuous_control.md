**Q1: I tried Udacity official implementation DPDG, it needs a significant tuning. What models are you trying?**

*z0k:* I havenâ€™t attempted this one yet. Still working through the first part of the ND. It was this project https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter

*andreiliphd:* Udacity owns flying cars company. If a manual is like Udacity course I guess pilots will be professional mathematicians. Strange but I love that in Udacity.
